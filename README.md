# FluxMind

Project developed using the Flutter and Firebase framework. The system was developed to obtain the partial grade of the discipline “Stage 1” of the undergraduate course in Computer Science - University of the State of Amazonas (UEA).

The system aims to allow teachers to create activities for their students to solve. It is also possible to check the progress of the class, viewing the number of problems solved and so on.
